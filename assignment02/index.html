		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img src="still.jpg" alt="Introduction" class="floatleft">
		<p>The Big Bang Theory is a sitcom that aired from 2007 to 2019, spanning 12 seasons and 279 episodes. The show follows a group of highly intelligent but socially awkward scientists as they navigate friendships, relationships, and geek culture. Blending science, pop culture, and humor, the show became one of the most iconic sitcoms of its time, making nerdy topics relatable to a broad audience.

		With its mix of intellectual debates, awkward social interactions, and hilarious misunderstandings, The Big Bang Theory struck a perfect balance between scientific accuracy and comedy. It introduced mainstream audiences to real-world physics concepts, popularized catchphrases like "Bazinga!", and created some of the most memorable sitcom characters in recent history.

		<h2>Geek Culture</h2>

		<p>A defining aspect of the show is its celebration of nerd culture, with characters deeply immersed in comic books, video games, and science fiction. They engage in heated Marvel vs. DC debates, make weekly trips to Stuart’s comic book store, and attend Comic-Con in elaborate cosplay. Star Trek, Star Wars, and Doctor Who references are frequent, with Sheldon idolizing Spock and regularly using the Vulcan salute.

		The show also introduces nerdy logic-based humor, most notably with "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock," a variation of the classic game designed to reduce ties. Their weekly Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, intense video game nights, and scientific debates reflect their deep-rooted geek culture. These elements helped bring nerd humor into mainstream entertainment, making what was once considered niche culture widely relatable.

		<h2>Reviews, Legacy & Spin-offs</h2>
