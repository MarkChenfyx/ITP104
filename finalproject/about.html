        <h1>About</h1>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        I'm a freshman at the University of Southern California, majoring in Mathematics and Philosophy.My academic interests are broad, but I’m particularly drawn to fields that are rich in structure and abstraction.I’m planning to attend graduate school and study more pure mathematics before entering industry.
        </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
        I’m drawn to reasoning frameworks that balance formal structure with conceptual depth. This includes areas like algebraic topology, type theory, epistemology, and structural linguistics. I’m especially interested in the intuitive clarity that comes from reconstructing something complex into something coherent.
        </p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
        My motivation often stems from epistemic curiosity. I enjoy systems that are layered and self-consistent, whether mathematical, computational, or linguistic. I tend to reflect before I act, and I value clarity more than speed. For me, understanding structure is often more fulfilling than applying it.
        </p>

        <h2>Recent Work</h2>
        <p>
        I'm currently interested in preparing for the Putnam exam and exploring topology and probability theory through coursework and personal study. I'm also part of a reading group on differential equations with Professor Victoria Chebotaeva.
        </p>

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>
        I'm able to use Python for light data analysis work. I’m keep learning SQL and working on some fun projects on Kaggle.
        </p>

        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>
        While I have a long-term interest in abstract mathematics, I’m also considering applied paths such as quantitative research. I hope to find work that offers structural richness and intellectual autonomy, while staying grounded in real-world systems.
        </p>
